# VR Teleoperation Experiment

Post Trial Interview Transcripts

## Participant 1

Q: So what did you find difficult if anything about those two tasks? (DC+DCD)

P: I'd say there's a, in the physical sense, a slight sense of nausea, but I suppose that's not specific to the task at hand it's more using VR. Generally the tasks were pretty easy - obviously with the second one there are points where, as long as you are generally on top of it, it's pretty easy to adjust for the fact that you've got a one-second delay, but if you find yourself in a situation where you have to suddenly make some panic moves then you can tend to make mistakes at that point so I suppose without that kind of protective feature of not bumping into things, it could be pretty problematic in that kind of environment.

Q: Other than the collision avoidance mechanism, was there anything else that you could think of that would have helped you during the task?

P: I suppose an obvious thing would be a map of the environment if it was known kind of like a heads-up display kind of thing. If you could see what the sort of general map is, then you can work out your path before you go. There's a lot of times when you get to the next junction and you can quite easily identify where you need to go but there's no guarantee that there's going to be a path through. So yeah, something like previous mapping using drones or something.

Q:What did you find hard about that method of control? (IC)

P: One issue is that it's hard to work out sometimes whether... So the waypoint system, when you point, if some things in the way, it seems like it's obstructing the path you're trying to choose. Whereas there's other times because you can kind of arc it over things, you can kind of choose waypoints behind something else a little bit you know when you're dealing with upright supports and stuff it seems like it's being blocked sometimes which can be a little bit frustrating when you're moving through those tight beams unless you can see a through-point and you can just pop out the other side in which case it's a lot easier

Q: Is there anything that you think could make that better? or in general make the task easier?

P: Whether it'd make it easier? I suppose having kind of system - I don't really know how this one currently works - but a system works you know the the again you're pointing a certain direction and the more you lift your arm the further it'll go rather than kind of directly throwing an arc - if that makes sense - which I don't know if that's how it currently works but it seems like, as I said before, that it tends to block whereas this way if it's already capable of plotting waypoints based on what's around, then you could just throw it behind things, but then I suppose that allows you to go straight to the end, so.. yeah it would kind of break this study I suppose.

Q: Which method of control did you prefer when there was no communication delay?

P: No communications delay? Still the Waypoint actually (Q: How come?) Especially when there's time... when it's a timed task so whether its time sensitive or something, it makes it a lot easier when the robot kind of takes the weight of actual path-planning away from you so it's kind of dealing with that itself all you have to do is pick so it's almost like strategy over direct control kind of thing and also just feels far

smooth that for the operator as well when it is making these kind of more smooth transitions between turns, as opposed to that kind of more jerky movement - which I think definitely doesn't help with the nausea. When you move left and right it's like \*doof doof\* (mimicking the noise of being bashed about) and it's a bit hard for your sense of balance to adjust to.

Q: So you felt more nausea in the DC one?

P: In the direct control one I think yeah

Q: And which method of control did you prefer when there was communication delay?

P: Again waypoints - I found it didn't really affect the Waypoint too much because you tend to be pre-planning your routes way ahead of time anyway. As soon as you see a path you kind of pick that path, and if it was only a second delay, that's not a huge issue. Whereas, with direct control if you screw up a turn or something, you directly have to deal with that and you and you're kind of jerking around you know it's been more awkward.

## Participant 2

Q: So what did you find difficult about those tasks?

P: The hardest thing was definitely the arrows (secondary task) - just making yourself aware that you got to click the arrows left or right. It wasn't particularly challenging. One of the things I struggled with the most was - and it didn't really affect performance much - but when I was aiming, I always got mixed up which button was to go (confirm target) and which button was to locate (select target), but I've sort of got the hang of it now. At the start I was just going click, click, click, click until I started moving there. Those were the two big ones.

I thought it'd be an issue with the with the the time delay of waiting a second but it wasn't too bad - it just meant, in my head, you have to think ahead, so before you get to that destination you choose where to move next, so by the time you do get there, it's altered it. But because it's constant path correction, it doesn't really seem to affect it too much. Those would be the big issues.

Q: Was there anything you thought that could make the system more easy to use?

P: Maybe the colours; it may be just me, but sometimes I got mixed up which colour meant what. Green is go and yellow you secure it and then green means you go to it maybe if those colours were a bit clearer or (the target circles) a bit bigger, but I'm red green colourblind slightly so I don't know if that affects it. I couldn't remember if yellow meant to go or green - as soon as I saw the green, I knew green meant go, but because you see yellow I was a bit like 'is red lock in?' and then yellow...

The fact that it shows the path you're going on was really really useful.

\*After Bonus\*

I thought my initial plan would be I'd go with manual control when it isn't delayed because, for some reason, I react quicker to the arrows with that (control method) I think, because you stay focused, maybe? That could be, a bit like with driverless cars, people just turn off because you know you're going that way. But, I didn't - I felt a bit more safe and a bit more confident to just follow the Waypoint all the way because it gets you there directly, especially when it had time delay because navigating those little rough bits is really hard with time delay using manual control.

I thought reactions were better if you've got manual, regardless of delay - basically if you just turn it the classic way. But, the performance is better with the waypoint, for both - especially with delay

And confidence (in the system), weirdly - that's a good one, the money (prize money for bonus round) actually tested it in a way - because my confidence when it was a gambling matter, I went with the one which is the safest bet, which I felt was the Waypoint.

Q: I think in that case probably knew that you could then just be one hundred percent focused on the arrows, whereas when there's nothing in it, your brain allows you to switch off when you're in waypoint control mode.

P: Yeah it does, and it's crazy because you think I've done that, I can just focus on the arrows now, but you don't! I guess also because it allows you to plan ahead - that's a biggie, yeah, that was awesome.

The waypoint had big learning curve to start with, because it's not like computer games, but once you got used to it, it was easier to use.

## Participant 3

Q: What did you find difficult about that control method and the task? (DC)

P: The delay - that was really frustrating. I kept walking into the bins. Because of the lag I kept going too far and then getting stuck in the bins and then having to turn all the way around to get out.

Q: Is there anything you can think of that would have improved your performance for that task? P: No lag.

Q: what did you find difficult or useful about the second control method?

P: It was useful that it path-planned, and went around all the objects it's kind of annoying that sometimes you that there were objects in the way (of the waypoint selector), so if you wanted to go behind the polls - if you aimed at the polls to go between them it blocks where I want to go (the target selector). So I can I see want to go left then forward but like there's a couple of polls in the way so I can't go to that spot but I can see it's clear. Even though I know I can get there - if I could turn the arc, then I could get it there.

Q: Overall which methods did you prefer when there was no communication delay?

P: The waypoint

Q: And when there was communication delay?

P: Still the waypoints

Q: Did either of the control method make you feel nauseous and, if so, which was worse?

P: Definitely the direct control, especially with the delay that made me feel quite sick. I think with the waypoints it did a little bit, while I was just getting used to it. But after that it was fine.

## Participant 4

Q: What are your thoughts on the two methods of control that you used?

P: So I think comparing them against one other I much preferred the waypoint one. It just seemed quite easy and intuitive to me. Whereas I didn't really like having to continuously have my thumb going one direct to manoeuvre around especially with the delay the direct control I found really annoying and frustrating to use that because it was like obviously with the delay you move and then it responds and you get all confused with like when you actually trying to point it and so I had to do quite a lot of Corrections and like reversing out as well when I was using the direct one with delay. The Waypoint with delay was a bit annoying but not as annoying as the direct control so of the four different methods I think the the Waypoint without delay was the one that I found kind of the easiest to use and the most intuitive

Q: So do you see there being potential issues when implementing that on a real robotic system? P: yeah with the delay you obviously probably will have to factor that in, if it exists but I think it would be a case of getting the operator used using it so I think it will be possible it wouldn't be it wouldn't be preferable for me personally if I was using it. I think if you had the Waypoint with the delay it's a lot better than having the directcontrol with the delay because you set the Waypoint and it doesn't matter if it takes a couple of seconds to actually do it, because you've told it where to go and you know that it's going to go there. I think that is the best way.

Q: So in the scenario where there was a communication delay and there's nothing you could do about it that's when you think the waypoint control would be most useful?

P: Yeah that's one of the ways where I think it has advantages over the direct control method is because it's a lot for me it was a lot easier to use the Waypoint with a delay than it was to use the direct control method with the delay.

Q: And which control if any made you feel nauseous?

P: Umm, towards the end of the direct control with with the delay made me feel a little bit nauseous I don't know if that was just because it was a longer period of time than the other ones, whether it was just longer exposure to it, or whether it was the delay, but it made me feel a bit sick and nauseous towards the end of that one

Q: Was there anything that could have made the waypoint control better?

P: No, I think the waypoint worked quite well. Maybe being able to point it a bit further, because you had to arc it up quite high in order to get it to go further. But I thought it was mostly pretty alright.

## Participant 5

Q: What are your thoughts on the two methods of control that you used?

P: I think I like the waypoint more better because it reduces the lower level thinking that you have to do,so you say go there and then it plans the path on its own, so going around all those bars, or going around the barrels I think it does it on its own and then while it is going there you have a chance to plan the next step the next place to go and then you can you can always choose a point that is very far away and then directly click there and go there so I think I like that. And the direct control also - I like the first one without the delay but then when there was delay I know it made me very nauseous yeah there was a point maybe 3/4 of the way through I thought okay maybe I Should just take off my headset so I didn't like the delay in that at all and I think in in both the cases I don't know if it's like a software thing or when there is a delay it made me more nauseous but when there was no delay it was fine andI think in the second case the delay didn't matter that much so all though I was expecting it to change quick so I was pressing the trigger twice but then I Press the trigger twice and then it moves so that oh okay fine there's a delay but it didn't matter much when I was doing the task I think. I know the one thing I I missed was maybe being able to see from a slightly higher viewpoint, so I can see farther ahead and then planned my route when I was doing the driving around. yeah like a higher up higher up view yeah maybe like I head on view or something like that, but otherwise I think it was OK.

Q: So which control method did you prefer without delay?

P: I would say waypoint, in both cases, with or without delay.

Q: Was there anything that you think with either of the controls that could have made it better? P: Yeah maybe also going slightly faster in the direct methodI think Waypoint is okay I didn't feel that I was going slow because I was always looking for the next step to go to, but in the direct control method Iwould have preferred that the robot went slightly faster I think yeah,because then I I think when when you're trying to do say going through the barrels you're focused on going through the barrels and not thinking about where the next step might be, but then in the waypoint one you just let it go through the barrels on its own and then scouting for places to go next anyway, so I didn't I didn't think about the speed so much because I was occupied with planning the next step I think, but in this one (DC) I wanted to go try out all the routes quickly enough so maybe speed.

Q: Any other feedback about the experiment?

P: No, I think overall I liked it. Yeah, reminded me of need for speed

Q: From a robotics point of view, can you see any challenges implementing waypoint control on an actual robot?

P: I think if it has a map and it knows where you are and there's somewhere to point where to go to it should be okay yes I say I know it can be a simple thing like shine a laser in front of you and then wherever it hits, the robot knows therobot knows where you are it roughly knows where the laser is hitting then it plans a path there I think yeah maybe direct control is easier to implement, because its just like driving a remote control car Q: yeah yeah it might affect it, well if is if it's if it's mapless and it's having to map at the same time, it might have to do more exploratory manoeuvres P: yeah I think I think you need like Iknow maybe some external cameras okay okay you can probably the robot can probably figure out its own location

## Participant 6

Q: So how did you feel about the intuitiveness of that control method?

P: it was very good actually I felt better with the delayed one because it was it was delay so after I made a decision I had a chance just to see before actually you know getting engaged if that was not correct so I could you know easily correct it that's why I think that the time of my second experiment (WCD) was about half the time of the first experiment (WC) yes some part of that may be because of the learning so I learn how to just deal with the robot, so my second was better. it's a combination of you know learning and yes and the delay has a positive effect actually

Q: is there anything that could have made the system easier to use?

P: I don't think you need this you know headset maybe on the PC it's better because it makes you feel dizzy yes I mean all the functions is fine, just with the PC.

\*Direct Control\*

Q: what did you think of that control method?

P: You know my research area is teleoperation you may not know but one second is a lot if you want to have an idea about the delay - human operator with five second delay he or she totally you know loses the you know just feel of you know your reality okay so the five yes second is the you know extreme limit OK and one second is a lot okay so don't think that yeah one second delay is something very short. I mean if you just go to the teleoperation paper you will see that one second is considered as a high high delay. So because the delay was high so I just you prefer the the first approach (WC) and as they do it for the teleoperation with high delay they just send high (level) command

Q: So how would you compare two different control methods waypoint control

P: The first one I mean the the waypoint yeah yeah the waypoint was much better and if I am going to choose let's say between the direct ones for said big ones without delay was the better okay

Q: so if you had no communications delay out of waypoint and direct control which would you choose?

P: still the waypoint yeah

Q and with delay?

P: with delay waypoint was better actually

## Participant 7

Q: So what did you think about the trial and the different control methods you saw?

P: yes okay I think I just took me a while to get used to the third one to the waypoint control because I thought I have to kind of navigate my way around obstacles I have to put the waypoints around the obstacles but then once I realize I just have to shoot and he will make the path there, that kind of make it so much easier that's so much less pressure on me not so much easier and the last one I really find it quite easy because I love the delay a bit because I shoot and point and then it kinda takes a while to kind of decide that that's where it's going, so that's kind of, you know, Ifelt quite easy about it. The most frustrating one was the one with direct control with delay that kind of really frustrated me because it was kind of always you have to be very focused what you're doing and know how much to press. First one (DC) I also enjoyed so my favorite one was the first one - the direct control - and Waypoint with delay because they kind of really good I really enjoyed working with them, they're quite easy

Q: so if there was no communication delay between you and the robot which control method would you prefer to use?

P: If there's no delay? I thinkI'll take the direct control yeah because that's very easy you can feel what you can feel as the robots, so it is quite easy to navigate and it's it's like playing video games so it's very easy yeah

Q: And the case where there is delay?

P: The case where there's a delay, I think the waypoints much easier.

Q: Is there anything else that could have improved either of the two methods?

P: I dunno, beside the robot being fast moving faster yes but other than that I think I think the Waypoint control was a bit frustrating sometimes -you can't like pick the crosshair it was really hard to put it especially with there's obstacle in front of you if somehow that was negated and just kind of worked behind obstacles then that would make it easier for me maybe yeah

Q: oh yeah so can you think of any issues with implementing the Waypoint control with a real system?

P: yeah I think the issues will be first the robot path planning itself will it be that good enough that it won't collide with objects so that's one area of concern. the other one will be just kind of how demanding the other tasks need to be, because Istill think that the direct control is kind of gives you much more ability todo other things, for instance press the buttons (secondary task) while the Waypoint control you still have to aim and shoot and it's much more demanding than just the normal one

## Participant 8

Q: So what if anything did you find difficult about that task?

P: it wasn't exactly difficult but I think the VR adds very little compared just a monitor yeah can have quite wide screen monitors or even curved monitors and projections now that are quite good and although you get the ability to see more in 3d space it doesn't offer much yeah

Q: So you didn't feel yourself looking around that much?

P: Not really

Q: and what do you think of the two methods of control?

P: Both work well. The route planning of the robot was quite good it got me where I needed to be, but using the more normal style of control was just as good to perform the task yeah

Q: did you feel that was the same when there was delay as well?

P: it is more frustrating using direct control with delay and does make you feel more nauseous I think. You don't really notice the delay with the waypoints. I noticed it more with direct control Q: So if you were to choose between them without delay, which control method do you think you would choose? P: obviously without delay.

Q: Sorry, I meant if you had no delay, which control method would you prefer to use?

P: for simplicity the Waypoint was pretty simple I think what you'd want to do is do getting to your objective by Waypoint and then once you're at the objective and need to do a more complex task you'd want to take over by using direct control.

Q: And if there was delay, still the waypoint?

P: there's not really a way around that it's gonna obviously gonna want it low latency as possible, but definitely waypoint.

Q: If you were to implement waypoint control on a real robot, what do you think the challenges might be?

P: route planning mainly if you're going away from waypoints like this way just going point to point to point and you're in control of the route planning, well the simpler side of the route planning, if you've got a large path to follow and it's got many obstacles that's going to be a bit more challenging for the system to work with.

Q: If you weren't doing the waypoint selection in VR, how do you think you would do it?

P: I don't think we necessarily need VR if you've got a wide-angle monitor I don't think that VR really adds that much other than you can look up and down side to side but you'd have several cameras mounted to the robot anyway so you probably going to cover all angles

Q: So do you envisage like clicking on the place you want to go, or something like that?

P: Yeah, I think that can still be mapped without needing a VR headset.

## Participant 9

Q: What were your thoughts on the trial and the control methods?

P: The control methods it's pretty easy to use both of them. The pointer is a little bit more easier I think than direct control but I feel better with the direct control I think. it feels like more I'm in control of the robots compared to the pointer.

Q: What about with delay?

P: It was pretty pretty disturbing mostly with the direct control because you do not have much time to think a lot with delay today. While, when you're using the pointer you have more time to think okay I'm now planning to go to that point so I have more time, so I feel less delay

Q: And so which of the control modes made you feel nauseous?

P: The first one

Q: So direct control?

Q: yeah

Q: with delay or both cases?

P: At the beginning also without the delay but I think I had to get used to the virtual environment

Q: and then was it still there a bit when you were doing the indirect control, or had it completely gone by then?

P: a little bit mostly when turning around because I am not feeling my body turns, so there's a difference between what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling, so that's a little bit confusing but after a while I got used to it.

Q: And is there anything that you thought could make the trial easier?

P: no not easier

Q: oh and did you think it was useful having it in virtual reality or would you have preferred it if the camera feed was on a screen?

P: I think virtual reality is a necessary step before controlling a real robot

Q: How come?

P: so I mean it's easier to use

Q: I mean imagine this was a real robot as do you think having it as an immersive interfaces and using a 360 camera - do you think that's useful? Or if it was a real robot would you prefer to just have the camera on a screen?

P: I think it's better with this setup and the cameras from the robot

Q: Why, because you can turn your head?

P: Yeah

## Participant 10

Q: what your thoughts on that method of control?

P: The whole method, with and without delay? Yeah it was fun I liked it yeah it was quite different I think the yeah overall I quite liked it. it was kind of nice for example when you could see through like kind of when there were pipes or something in the way but you could see on the other side - you could just put a point there and then the robot kind of goes all the way around rather than having to like go all the way yeah and then it feels feels nice because your vision is independent from where the robots going I guess so you can kind of look around while it's moving and decide where to go next

Q: Was there anything that you found difficult about the task?

P: I guess, nah not that hard, I think just like you know sometimes like things getting in the way I guess if there's a column in the middle of you have to kind of wait to go around it but I wouldn't say there were difficulties it's like yeah just frustrating when there's something in the way.

\*Direct Control\*

Q: Did any of those trials make you feel nauseous

P: Yea, but I think it's just the ones I was moving my head more I think whenever I was moving my head quickly I felt a tiny tiny bit of nausea

Q: Which trials were the worst?

P: So I think it was the two last ones yeah - direct control and direct control with delay - but yeah I was literally just when I move my head too quick it felt a tiny bit...

Q: it's weird because I think actually it has a lot of effect that there is that delay between when your brains thinks 'okay it's gonna start to turn now'

P: And then it doesn't, yeah

Q: In the indirect (waypoint) control with delay did you feel much nausea?

P: No I don't think so no

Q: What were your thoughts now you've seen both control methods?

P: Yeah well the main thing I would say is that the delay with the waypoint I didn't feel like made a huge amount of difference like it felt still manageable because you can kind of predict you've got a bit of time to like set the next waypoint essentially whereas direct control was a bit manic like I got stuck a few times and then it was like trying to quickly get away from an obstacles or something so the delay in the direct control I think had a massive effect It made it a lot harder whereas in the waypoint control it didn't seem that bad yeah I guess it also depends on the robot speed and stuff but yeah but at that speed yeah yeah. I'm sure there's like did you, was there a question about video games yeah cuz I feel like that could like if you're used to playing video games I don't know why I feel like that could help yeah a little bit

Q: I think I think that I'm slightly worried that I haven't got enough non-video game players because I think it does have an impact on both control conditions

P: so I think I put that I play some video games but I think it also probably depends the type of video games because I don't really play much - it's stuff like magic online - so it's not really things are relevant to like control moving around that much yeah it was really cool and it was nice to do a bit of VR actually

Q: Do you think having it in VR was beneficial to the task?

P: No I think it was beneficial well I think yeah I think it was beneficial because of the thing I was saying about being able to scout the environment while you're moving I mean I guess you could do that on a screen but then you'd have to have an extra control thing to move the view around whereas there you can just do it naturally - do your tasking with your left hand and moving with your right hand so yeah, I thought I thought it was better in VR probably.

Q: You could also possibly have a 180 or 360 screen or something

P: oh yeah yeah yeah that's true yeah to avoid the nausea thing yeah you could you could do that even with like one screen I suppose you could come up with a way of, but ya you could yeah they have interesting yeah yeah are you thinking of trying that or?

Q: Probably not I want to just get on and just try implementing this on a real robot

P: Yeah that'd be really cool well yeah yeah

Q: There's definitely more stuff you could test though

## Participant 11

Q: yeah so what were your thoughts on the two control methods?

P: I would prefer the second one, the waypoint control, yeah yeah I would prefer that one because it seemed cool like it paralyzed like physical and also mental work yeah I don't need to be really focused I can like like let the robot controls which way it wants to go and I finally get to the destination that I wanted to achieve and I would more be more comfortable

Q: And did you feel like you trusted the robot to path-plan and get to the position you told it to?

P: yes because from myself I'm not very familiar with the environment and I need to try like maybe like five meters of room in front of me and I need to try like if I can squeeze in this to to like to space that can squeeze inside and I can get now like trapped inside and for the robot to be path-planning I think it is easier because it can have algorithm and it can find the most appropriate way without spending more time trialling different routes - this way then back and going that way

Q: so did you prefer the waypoint control without delay and with delay - as in if there was no delay and delay you preferred the waypoint in bot cases

P: Yea I prefer the same same systems - the waypoint control - in both cases

Q: yeah was there anything you thought could make either of the two control systems better?

P: for me the first one that is really simple to use and it's more like a control game like you used to play when you were a child but the problem is that the robot moves real slow and you can't really view the whole environment like you don't have a view of the whole environment - you can't say like if there's a space you can go if there's a space you can go, so if for more fluency of the views it's better to create a view for the users to see like I can view from some other point instead of the view from the robot only yes - like a map or something I mean it's like you can find out there's a space there's a space I can choose it's like a puzzle and you can say that I can I can have a path planning in my head to say like I'm going to go this way but for this for this control experiment I have to try if I can go this way, which takes more time. But if I had a map, maybe in top of top right of the screen maybe is going to be better but also I noticed that for the secondary task if I use the Waypoint method to control the robot I have more time to do this secondary task - I can be more focused on the secondary task. In the first method I am mainly focused about finding the route yes I almost forgot I still have a secondary goal

Q: So say you had a map that you could refer to whilst moving do you think you still prefer using waypoint control?

P: yes actually to be honest for the waypoint control I don't really need a map, yeah I kind of just directly say from the robots prediction and I can just use the controllers to choose which point I want go and it doesn't matter because I don't need to say whether this space is large enough for me to pass through but for the first control method I think you need a better point of view to say where to go.

## Participant 12

Q: What were your thoughts on the two different control methods?

P: I definitely found the waypoint control was a lot easier particularly with the with the delay one yeah it was kind of fine because you can see when I would you know I could see oh well it's about a second or so delay so I could kind of build that into my own path decision making and the I guess with the even though it made me feel quite sick with the direct control with the delay it was kind of okay when things were going well but as soon as I got kind of stuck it seemed to take me a lot longer to get out of that situation

Q: is there anything in either the control methods that you thought could have made it easier?

P: I don't know maybe something that if the delay is kind of consistent like a small time on or something that will tell you how long the delay might be you know something like a spinning wheel that fans out a one second delay so you kind of have a visual aid to help with the delay but no it was pretty easy to use to be honest, the waypoint

Q: do you think that you were immersed in the virtual world - do you think that is that beneficial to the task?

P: yeah I think so it was nice being able to kind of look around and plan the route and for the waypoints definitely for the waypoint control yeah I think it was better having the immersive view.

Q: From a usability point of you would you prefer to have it on a screen because of the nausea you experiencced?

P: yeah for me personally yeah I would yeah

Q: And if you were to have it on a screen would you favour as big a screen as possible?

P: Yeah definitely I would yeah yeah I guess sort of the ability to get some kind of like double joystick control you could have one moving the robot and one panning the head (camera)

Q: if there's a 360 camera I guess you're guessing the same like did you turn it doesn't have to be delayed because you've received that image so when you turning it you are turning within the image so maybe actually if you had a secondary controller you could turn without delay Q: yeah anything else, any other feedback?

P: why is it what is it that it makes some people sick? Is it the slight kind of delay

Q: so no I think one of the things is that visually you witness turning, but you don't see turning

P: Oh so it throws off your sense of balance

## Participant 13

Q: So what your thoughts on the two control methods and the task in general?

P: I thought they were both fine but I think because I have more experience in VR with the tracked paths that the direct control maybe is a bit easier to me than other people, but yeah the Waypoint stuff - assuming that like the path planning is all optimal - then it's pretty easy to use yeah it also works a lot better with the delay so because then with a delay in direct control you have to like kind of make it a little bit of prediction like there is a bit of a learning curve to it and sometimes you get a little bit wrong but yeah like the waypoints with the delay like you can see the point before you actually submit it which is kind of nice

Q: So in the case where there is no delay which would you choose to drive with?

P: Depends on the scenario I guess but I'd be fine with either way okay yeah I felt like with the race bit (bonus trial) I just decided to go for waypoint control assuming that it just goes for the optimal plan which I'm not able to do with direct control like you like your thumbs a little bit off then you're already are veering off the optimal line where as the Waypoint just takes you there so yeah

Q: And with communications which would you choose?

P: the Waypoint yeah

Q: Any other feedback - anything to do with task or anything like that?

P: I don't know maybe with the motion sickness right because with the Waypoint stuff I noticed that it it's a bit more prominent because it just suddenly can like rotate you on an axis while you're watching that way I noticed that if I turned with the motion of the robot that's a lot less so if and you can see the line so you can see when the robots about to turn so you could just like turn with the robot which seems to help a lot yeah diminish the virtual reality sickness so I don't know if that's something you want to tell people but

Q: yeah as I say like if it was a proper system it would definitely do arced turns anyway rather than the strafing turns rather so hopefully it would be better, although I mean there's gonna be other challenges and other issues, but yeah

## Participant 14

Q: So what do you think about the comparison between the two control methods?

P: which one if you want to do it would be better?

Q: yes you have direct control first and then you had waypoint control. which did you prefer to use?

P: The Waypoint I think it is easier because you don't have to deal with obstacles and narrow stuff and the robot passes them automatically I think combination of both would be the best. When I see where I'm gonna go I can point and that's easier for example when there's a small hole small way and have to go there then I will put the target there and I don't have to deal with centring the robot, but I'm not sure where I'm gunna go and I have to do a little bit of you know short movements then I think for small movements, the accuracy of direct control is better for example yeah I'm gonna go a little bit here that I see there yeah sure

Q: so is there anything else you wanted to say? I know you found using VR sickness inducing but did you find it useful for the task?

P: yeah I think I would prefer it on a screen, but did you did you have any results that people prefer VR better than screens

Q: there are some yeah, not from me, but there are some out there, but yeah, sickness is a big issue. I actually don't know, I would be interested to see when you have a real camera feed rather than the virtual environment whether it's better or not, I have a feeling that it would be better but I don't know

P: I'm not sure because the fact that the camera is still moving - unless you have if you have a little bit of up and down movement it would help a lot.

Q: The other thing is oh yeah you could you can like could attach the rotation of the camera from the robot so like give this the 360 feed you just keep the person like facing the same way so they would have to have physically turn to like turn with the robot that way it's bit more physically demanding but like you wouldn't have that turning thing which is I think what a lot of the sickness is caused by and the other thing people do for the sickness in my previous lab is they project that into a screen in VR and you can have a lot live feeds going on and you feel like something like you're sitting on the robots mind it has a nice name like you sit inside the brain then you see from the eyes like yeah

Q: I wonder if moving the screen further away from your eyes would help so you don't get the same peripheral vision but I think that might be better

P: So you mean you don't feel as immersed

Q: yeah yeah see like if you you slide that away it's meant to be for people with glasses mainly but it's actually quite it's quite weird actually possibly quite annoying right there's nothing on that

## Participant 15

Q: So what were your thoughts on the two different control methods?

P: It was way easier to use the waypoint control I think although I feel like it took some of the difficulty out of it like it did some path planning itself so there were sometimes where I would say go to this point and it would go around in a different way than I intended but it still got to there

Q: Was it a bit annoying when it did that?

P: a little bit I guess yeah only a small amount though. it's still fine yes there's a difference between what you tell it to do and what actually does sometimes

Q: yeah so which do you think you preferred in the case when there's no delay

P: No delay I think that's it would still be the waypoint control.

Q And with delay?

P: It would be the same I think, still the waypoint

Q: Do you think there's anything you found particularly difficult about the task?

P: Not in the task, but in the training when I was using waypoint control I got stuck in a corner and I was trying to turn back around directly behind me I couldn't really do it - I couldn't figure out how to do it so I go a long way around yes so direct control for that would be better yeah but waypoint control for general purpose navigation

Q: yeah do you think in general for fine control to get to a specific position, direct control would be better?

P: yeah probably

Q: did you do you feel nauseous in either of the second two trials?

P: No I felt fine

## Participant 16

Q: What were your thoughts on the two different control methods you saw?

P: Waypoint was far easier because you just have to point it and then it moves on itself whereas direct control required a bit more effort.

Q: yeah so did you prefer it in both the with and without the delay case?

P: without the delay case of course is better and I would prefer waypoint over direct control So if I had to rank it without delay Waypoint control (WC) then without delay direct control (DC) and the with delay waypoint (WCD) and then with delay control (DCD)

Q:And is there anything that could have made either of the control methods better?

P: well apart from response time I can't think of anything yeah okay

Q: so one of the thoughts I had was in direct control if you pressed down on the direction it would set it in that direction rather than you having to constantly hold

P: yeah that that would be an improvement

Q: Did you find it annoying having to constantly have your finger on the controller?

P: yeah yeah I guess but at the same time i think I mean it's like in control of a car you always have your hands on the wheel yeah yeah maybe you press the button then it wouldn't react to turns as accurately like would be softer reaction they react soft more softer way wouldn't turn so suddenly

Q: yeah okay and there was anything in the waypoint control that you thought would have made it easy for you to use?

P: No, it's fine

Q: great and is there any other feedback about the experiment

P: no it's pretty good - one of the better experiments that I've had with VR here

Q: did you feel nauseous at all in either of the second two trials?

P: Yea a bit, the delayed one made me a little bit more nauseous yeah but as I'm not prone to motion sickness it wasn't too bad

Q: okay so you didn't feel like you were close to having to stop or anything like that?

P: No

## Participant 17

Q: yeah so what are your thoughts on two different control methods

P: I preferred the not where you use the touch (direct control) but where you project (waypoint control) yeah I preferred that one yeah

Q: just all round? even when you had no communication delay would you still prefer that one?

P: i actually prefer that one the most yeah I thought that was nicer than the one that directly followed

Q: How come?

P: I don't know it fell it was more predictable yeah so with getting nauseous you often get nauseous if something unexpected happens and because that delay was there but you still knew where it was going that was more pleasant yeah but with the delay with the touchpad it was more like because my my control wasn't always exactly where I thought it was it would move in different directions yeah

Q: so you like the fact that you had the path plotted out?

P: Yeah

Q: and is there anything in either of the tasks that could have made it easier?

P: I think it also depends on gaming experience but with what the touchpad I'm just not very experienced with that so I just thought that was more difficult in general

Q: so if it was like a joystick for instance you might prefer that?

P: yeah I think so especially because you can really see where you are on the touchpad you have something that's more clear on where you're going

Q: And was there any other feedback about the experiment?

P: No, sounds good

P: what exactly are you looking at? you're you're looking at the two conditions and so I imagine that your hypothesis is not that the delay would be preferred so why did you investigate the delay?

Q: so it's what I'm actually interested in it's kind of become more clear as I've run the experiment is the fact that when there is delay like when there's known today people are kind of like yeah I I don't I don't really mind between two they're both kind of alright, but when there is delay people are like definitely think the waypoint control is easier or better and that kind of feeds into yes like a yeah so it's just like yeah so I'm interested in seeing like so I'm interested in seeing whether that is the case and yeah in systems where there is inevitably a communications delay I can say that this would be a better way of controlling the robot. oh yes like did you think the fact that it were in VR helped you at the task at all? Or would you have preferred if it was on like a screen?

P: I have no idea because for the task you don't depend that much on well I think I think it's depends whether you could like move the screen that you're looking at or whether it's static because now when when we had when I had to turn left or when when I turned left then it was nice that I could actually see where I was going so I guess it depends on whether you can still turn (the camera) in the not VR condition as well or whether it's like more like like your static screen

Q: so yeah so you might have yeah

P: Well the easy thing I guess is if you you can usually turn when you're just looking at the screen like that but then you need the button for that yeah don't need that now and I did notice that with with the arrow task that one was more difficult for me with the Waypoint yeah you said yeah so I can't imagine that if that is the one to go (to be used) then having a controller to actually turn the screen might be less nice than VR where you can just turn your head

Q: yeah that's interesting because I've witnessed that - I think my kind of guess is that it's because direct control you're kind of quite active you're like low-level active the whole time till so your brain is quite engaged and so when something comes up that's just like I just need to do that it's not that big a deal whereas with the waypoint control you go through these peaks where when you're looking to do something it's like higher mental load so you kind of forget about the arrows and then when you're all sitting back kind of like much less engaged - you go through these like peaks and troughs of engagement which is actually makes the secondary task worse.

P: you know what I just thought would be really interesting if you include EEG in this to see the brain activity

Q: yeah that would cool

P: just something I just thought of

Q:Yes I could do that in future studies

P: We were discussing yesterday they're thinking about buying a wireless EEG so that might be an option although you wear it around the head I think, so I don't know how that would work with the VR headset

Q: Yeah that's true, hopefully the next version of the VIVE will also have EEG built in as well as eyetracking

## Participant 18

Q: What did you think of the two control methods that you used?

P: The Waypoint was way better so that was actually the notes that I made was that the path planning and avoidance of obstacles puts a massive advantage on the Waypoint method because you don't have to think and as you said I think I didn't necessarily take the most direct routes I was pre I was looking at the environment and trying to be clever about avoiding obstacles and I wasn't looking at gaps and assuming I wouldn't fit which i think is why I took more complex methods routes that I may be needed to but the Waypoint just took care of that actually yeah and I on reflection now I know a little bit better the fact that the Waypoint just finds you a route to where you want to go that's amazing compared to the self-direct one yes so it was loads better. The only other thing is that I noticed that the second the maps were repeated right yeah so obviously the second time around you know roughly where you're going yeah

Q: it's flipped

P: oh it was flipped okay okay

Q: Well mirrored

P: that's the thing that was the other thing is that I I really felt at the mercy of the I wouldn't have gone that way with the Waypoint control that difference in route wasn't really me re-planning it was just trying to get through with the controllers that I'd got yeah and actually like you know you're going in one direction and the lag ends up taking you further than you intend anything I'll just try and find a route so actually the control method really affected my route planning yes as opposed to it being the other way around which is really what it should be waypoint was a really intuitive and easy yeah and even though it was like it was also kind of less boring which is a bit odd because given that with the direct control you'd think I'd be more engaged it wasn't because it was just like I had to be attending to it but it was not fun yeah

Q: interestingly I'm not sure if the response time to the secondary task will really show up as different because if anything direct control you're kind of you're

P: having to look at the screen

Q: yeah you're quite engaged

P: there was a difference though because sometimes like obviously with the Waypoint unless the arrow popped up directly as I was triggering I was free to tick it yeah whereas I often had to stop if I was like making a tricky maneuver especially if I was right about to hit something and I was always now predicting when to try and do it a bit sooner because of the delay like to turn a bit sooner because of the delay there was a few times where I like I noticed myself leaving actively leaving the red arrow a minute while I did that so it might not be significant but it definitely was easier on the Waypoint

Q: it might show up in the delay case that the response times are better for waypoint control

P: but I would be very surprised if anyone really preferred the direct control control with the lag especially because the thing with the Waypoint is you you go so far in advance that the delay ceases to matter yeah because you were probably well I was I was using it in quite a heavy-handed way oh I just like go roughly in there and before I get to the end I've made the next point yes so the delay ceases to be a problem yeah whereas with the direct control it was awful I really didn't like it

Q: Is there any other feedback about the experiment?

P: no just what like I said at the beginning it's really awesome I really really like the way that you did the tutorial with the the video playing the voiceover I think it's definitely something we should think about more as a group even just the idea of recording the instructions rather than the repeat the experimenter doing them every time yeah really cool

Q: and did you find the fact the fact you're in VR was beneficial for the task?

P: yeah because actually um one of so for example with Paul's I think you could control the direction that the robot was facing but you had to do it with the joysticks so it was an additional thing to have to do is to be able to just turn my head to be able to sort of look rather than have to turn - that was super intuitive whereas if I was looking at it on a screen and therefore had to have an additional one of the additional triggers - I know that we had like the distractor task yeah which was so I could have used this one (controller) but that's even something in videogames I've never been that keen on I think when you have to combine motion with also head direction if I play video games I tend to turn it into automatic camera following because I don't like having to do both I find it quite confusing so I guess for that reason in the first instance yes it was better yeah. In terms of like path planning and stuff yeah because the linked to that again you were able to more quickly scan the environment so yeah I think so

## Participant 19

Q: what your thoughts on the two different control methods?

P: I think I prefer the waypoint control okay because it's mainly because it made I think it actually made the navigation and the feeling of the VR thing and knowledge better I don't know what happened in the first time yeah but because the robot was already on a path and then you could choose the next Waypoint then you could basically tell when the robot I don't know it felt smoother for some reason, I can't exactly pinpoint why because direct control we also control it but yeah it felt it felt easier

Q: if you had a system with no communication delay do you think you'd still choose waypoint control?

P: yes yes because I think because for example if you don't have very good control of the controller and for some reason you do sudden movements in direct control you'll actually feel that yeah whereas with the Waypoint control it's a lot smoother yeah

Q: so like for instance if you had a possibly with direct control better input with a joystick would that be better?

P: Maybe

Q: so I know it made you feel a bit sick but do you think the VR was beneficial to the task

P: yes yes definitely yeah because I could look around I didn't have only the viewpoint of the robot as it was moving I could look around and see where I could go next yeah

Q: yes so if it didn't make you sick then you'd prefer it?

P: yes yes sometimes it made me sick so I was like no I well I will not turn my head now but but yeah yeah I think it's helpful

Q: and was anything you thought could make performing the easier?

P: not really - a thought would be basically maybe the viewpoint if it was a lot higher I mean still following the robot but being a lot higher so you have a better view around and maybe that would also help with nausea my main issue was the nausea that I don't think had anything to do with the experiment yeah yeah

Q: I mean I haven't been properly measuring people's - I haven't been tracking how sick they're feeling but I think the control method probably does affect it

P: It does yea I think so yeah

Q: if I was to implement this on a real system it is something I would look at

## Participant 20

Q: so what are your thoughts on the two different methods of control?

P: um I really didn't like the one where you have to manually control like you have to keep your finger on the thing especially with the delay it was pretty terrible. But the waypoint one, even with the delay you can't really notice because you keep going like before you get to the next thing you pressed you've already chosen the next one anyway. With delay or without delay it's the same.

Q: Was there anything that could have made either control method better?

P: No

Q: How about if you could set a velocity and not have to constantly press the button in direct control?

P: I think that in the one without delay that might have been good bit with the delay you keep on having to like shift anyway so it probably wouldn't help

Q: so do you think the fact you were in VR helped with the task?

P: I think so because if you were doing it in 2d like I was often trying to figure out where to go before I had actually turned the corner so I think that was probably easier if you're in you know inside the actual VR space and you can see like how far things are and get an idea where to go maybe yeah

Q: so kind of like situational awareness was better than if you were viewing it on a screen?

P: Yea I'd say so

Q: any other feedback?

P: No that was good. did you like you know the the control things at the beginning the tutorials they were really good did you get the ideas from the other guys because some of the other guys didn't do that like they didn't have the in VR space tutorials pointing to what controllers where which

Q: yeah it was partly like did you do \*Name redacted's\* VR study he had like a video of someone doing a task and then you know I added the button thing

P: Yeah that was very good

## Participant 21

Q: what were your thoughts on the two different methods of control?

P: I think I guess probably a couple of things so in terms of the the one where it's under direct control it's probably more physical effort to be like pushing down even though it's quite trivial thing but you're like finger energy expanding yeah but then when the delay comes on like well I think in either scenario the waypoint model is easier but it's clearly better when the when the delay is on okay I feel like you barely noticed the delay actually once the Waypoint is on but yeah yeah

Q: anything else anything you thought could have made made either control methods better or easier for this task?

P: it might have been nice to have like a preview like you know when you're pushing out your arc your dot there could be like a like faint line showing which direction you're going to go around obstacles and stuff whether that would be helpful or not so you like preview the route that's gonna be you know because when the redline comes on yeah to preview the redline before the decision is made to know where the robot will actually go because like it's not going to go in a straight line necessarily

Q: I hadn't thought of that, but that's actually quite a good idea.

P: yeah you move it around and then you'd see these Wiggly lines kind of adapting as you move and it could be sort of faint before you're finally selecting it and then it goes on because like for instance when you're under those what would you call it like the metal grids the prongs you know like it goes round it in a certain way yeah but maybe you don't fully anticipate until you press go yeah and then you realize it's taken a slightly different route to what I would have expected but not I mean I guess most of the time that's not going to be a problem but maybe if you want to maintain like as much control as you can it would be nice to know in advance yeah I guess maybe especially if you're navigating like radioactive environments because you want to avoid radiation and stuff you might it might you know you might want to skirt around your radioactive barrels a bit more if if you possibly can

Q: So potentially a bit more control over which route it takes as well?

P: Well I suppose it what it could do is like flash up with like potential routes that are sort of costed in different ways because you obviously you've got like a minimum distance routes you could have like minimum radiation exposure routes and so that could flash up as like color-coded so I red for minimum distance Green for minimum radiation yep you know that kind of thing and then you could have a different button to like flick between which one is being chosen

Q: Do you think being in VR helped with the task or would you have preferred it if it was on a screen?

P: Oh I see - I would probably just want it on a screen realistically just because you've got the weight of the thing on your head yeah and if somebody's standing next to you and you don't know where they are like in the scenarios that we tried there weren't many occasions where you have to do like 180 turns and I only tried doing it a little bit but once you start turning behind yourself you start to become a bit disorientated about yeah which way you're pointing in reality so I mean can you do like I guess you can do it's called augmented reality isn't it yeah where you've got a blend of the real scene and the virtual scene yeah you can get like those google glasses things can't you where it's kind of shown I mean that might be a kind of cool thing to try yeah rather than like fully one or the other yeah yeah no but it's fun study

## Participant 22

Q: what were your thoughts on the two control methods?

P: Waypoint controls definitely better. I'd question how it's going to be like figured out with the robotic system because I guess it's like doing path planning based on like the map I don't know how that be done if it's just a robot trying to like look at its environment and then figure out what the best route is gonna be yeah it might be it has like occluded vision at some points that wouldn't actually know what the best route would be yeah the other method, direct control was actually quite simple to use as well so I think either two would be fine

Q: So if there was if you had a system with no communication delay which do you think you'd choose to use?

P: I'd probably choose the waypoint yeah

Q: and if there was a system delay which would you use?

P: probably waypoint as well

Q: And was there anything that could have made either control method better?

P: maybe just some smoothing on like the turn I think every time you turn is when it's kinda like playing with your inner ear yeah so I think the direct method your turning so constantly that that kinda messes with your head a bit whereas the waypoints was a bit smoother it's quite nice.

Q: Do you think the fact that it used an immersive interface was useful for the task? Or would you have preferred if it was outputted on a screen?

P: It felt quite natural I guess to have my head turning and to have the vision changing with it that was quite good yeah I can see benefits both I guess yeah if the nausea could be emitted that would be great

## Participant 23

Q: What do you think about the two different control methods?

P: I would say that the direct one gave you like more choices on the spot of where you wanted to go but with the with the other one with the Waypoint in like I thought it gave me more facility of whilst it was moving to be able to check what would be my other options if that makes sense because as I know already where it's going it gives me a certain time to check ok so where is the next step that I'd like to follow so I would say I prefer the directed one the dist one Waypoint sorry Waypoint control okay so like

Q: in what situations would you do you think you would use one control method or the other, if there was no delay?

P: I would use the I would prefer the Waypoint probably yeah among the two I would still like the chance to be able to flip between the two if that makes sense but I would say I would prefer the Waypoint because you would still give me a chance to look at the environment while I'm already moving and knowing where I'm going to move if that makes sense

Q: and if you have a system with a delay would you prefer the waypoint then as well?

P: I prefer the Waypoint because she would give me even more time if that makes sense to check the surroundings yeah and see where where I could go next

Q: was there anything you thought could improve either of those two control methods?

P: I would say in the other one in the direct one as its direct I guess you'd have to get the hang of moving it around but I thought it was pretty cool because it gives you complete freedom of where you want to move it on the spot and I really like the waypointing one as well because as I said like you already know more or less where you go and you can change it at any stage you don't have to wait until the end so you it gives you a bit more of time for decision-making if that makes sense

Q: and do you think having it in an immersive headset where you turn and the camera view turns with your head, do you think that was beneficial to this task or do you've preferred it on just a screen like the camera and it would move?

P: yeah I prefer there as it is now that whenever the robot turn it would turn that visuals because I know exactly what orientation it is at all times yeah so I would prefer it like that yeah

Q: Was there any other feedback about the experiment?

P: no when's the next one?

Q: I'm hoping to implement this on an actual robot using augmented reality

P: okay okay that sounds pretty cool so yeah whenever you need more participants

## Participant 24

Q: what were your thoughts on the two different control methods you saw?

P: I think the direct control without the delay is a lot better than the other one with the delay because it's still giving me some dizziness but the delay is really bad yeah so I feel it's quite easy to use - not that bad yeah with the delay you've got quite a significant delay between the control and the reaction of the robot so I don't feel like that's that's practically easy to use

Q: so what about the waypoint control vs direct control?

P: I feel the direct control giving you more freedom to go yeah the other one maybe it's more accurate I guess because you can pick the exact point where you want to go but you can't really change your path Midway and trying to cope with things that might appear on your way really I guess

Q: so if you have to choose a control method with delay

P: I don't like the delay at all

Q: What about in the waypoint control method?

P: it's less of I feel less sick with it because it kind of like taking things slowly yeah yeah and what are the direct control with delay i feel really sick yeah I don't like it at all

Q: so if you have a system without delay and you've got to choose between the two control methods?

P: I would prefer the waypoint control with delay rather than the direct control

Q: so with delay you choose the waypoint yeah? How about if you have a system with no delay?

P: oh I would prefer with no delay

Q: oh yeah so if you have a system with no delay which control would you prefer?

P: Direct control

Q: and do you see the fact it was like immersive helps with the tasks or would you prefer if the camera feed was on the screen?

P: I quite like the immersive yeah you can see everywhere around you and it's I think it's better if you have like you can match it with actual movement rather than just sitting down and let the camera rotate because it might give you dizziness from that yeah yeah so you can move your body as you walk around as well but like when you're on like a treadmill or something when you walk wearing it it will be much better than just sitting down and let the camera rotate around yeah

Q: so if you if you had to if the - you know the camera turned with the robot yeah if you have to physically turn yourself instead?

P: I think will be I will prefer that just yeah yeah I have full control of the camera

Q: yeah it's more physically demanding

P: I don't think it would be that physically demanding because you don't lift anything. I don't think I can do much work now after this need to take a minute yeah I feel really sick like you're on a coach really bumpy coach

## Participant 25

Q: what did you think about the two different control methods?

P: as in with the delay?

Q: oh well the direct control versus the waypoint control?

P: I think the second one (waypoint control) was better because it had that sort of Auto navigation so for starts without the delay the auto navigation kind of helped a lot and when I had the delay it was much easier. it almost took away the delay because the difference between it with the delay and without the delay with the waypoint you know it was you kind of had to just remember oh yeah there's a delay that's why it's not responding immediately mm-hmm whereas of course with the you know between without it and you're just clicking it (direct control) you feel uneasy a bit nauseous and you kind of it gets quite frustrating as well because you're like I want to go that way then there's lots of back and forth I think it took about twice as long doing it just with the delay but you know just trying to push it there

Q: Yeah so if you have a system without delay which control method do you think you'd choose to use?

P: I think the second one (waypoint control) was more practical the first one (direct control) you'd think it's because it's more VRy it kind of feels a little bit more fun to start with but I think you'll be able to complete tasks much easier more reliably with the second method okay

Q: and if you had a system with delay?

P: yeah definitely the second one

Q: Was there anything you thought could have made either of the control methods better?

P: I think if you were for that for the first control with the delay if you had some something on the screen which keeps track of what you've pressed that could be quite useful so say you press a forward button a little arrow on the right hand of the screen or something shows a floored button and then every time you press it and then as it does it it sort of

Q: Like a buffer of previous control inputs?

P: Yeah and then you can kind of see where you are I think one of the things that you've got to kind of get your head around the fact that there's a delay and to be able to sort of keep track of where you are what you've already done you know having that you know visual aid could be quite useful yeah

Q: I could imagine a bit like air guitar where you like have the arrow the control inputs you've done and a bar where it's passing through the robot

P: I was kind of thinking like dance mat but yeah that's the same same kind of principle

Q: so do you think that you had an immersive interface was useful for the task?

P: Compared to having it on on screen yeah potentially you can kind of look around a bit although I'm not sure to be honest because it you kind of because it's cool you kind of say oh yeah it's a better way of doing it yeah but in a practical environment it might not be I think because I've not had the comparison well I think you could for navigation it's much easier because you can sort of you can look around and you can see while you're doing something where you're where you want to go and you sort of you can construct a path while you're doing something else which is quite good and also would take away distraction I get quite easily distracted so I think if it was like on the screen while it's doing stuff I can't look around in the actual room whereas in there because you're also quite immersed in it you're so you have to focus on it which is quite good

Q: I think personally I think it is useful especially as you say for navigation tasks like that and it's just you've got to get over the hurdle of causing nausea because that's much more detrimental on people's experience than having it on a screen

P: Yeah absolutely

## Participant 26

Q: so yeah what were your thoughts on the two methods of control?

P: So the the direct control was way easier to pick up but then the communications delayed made that sort of really quite frustrating immediately so yeah I can see but there what the I felt that communication delay wasn't really so much of a problem with the Waypoint control because you could almost like you just giving yourself a plan time to plan ahead so it didn't really matter that it was taking a second because you've I was trying to set the Waypoint so far away that it didn't really matter how long it took to respond because I kind of had a rough idea where it's gonna go anyway yeah

Q: And was yeah was there anything in either of the two control methods that could have made it better?

P: with the direct control um sort of yeah finer control because you only have really have yeah sort of two options when you're trying to move forward of sort of like diagonal or or forward but there I think if you were getting really good at at this control method you would you'd want sort of a much finer control like almost like analog yeah steering

Q: Like a joystick?

P: yeah that would make that a lot a lot easier even on the joypads cuz they're they're quite they feel quite natural and easy to to hold yeah so yeah that that would definitely make it a lot easier. The Waypoint control I'm not sure if there's anything like if anything if the reticule that you're aiming for could go further that that would have made it easier to use yeah yeah but I suppose there's also kind of you can't see very far ahead so there's a trade-off there - I suppose if the camera was higher then

Q: so do you think having it in like being immersed in the camera feed was beneficial to the task or would you have preferred if it was just on the screen

P: no I think being an immersed in it is quite good because as especially in the Waypoint control because it's helping you do that planning ahead so as I was sort of moving as I was letting the robot move from point to point then I was sort of looking around thinking about where next to sort of go and I think I wouldn't have had that same experience with the screen because I would have been limited to either controlling like a pan and tilt camera or something whilst it's moving or which it would take like a kind of cognitive load or just looking straight forward and then having to explore left and right with the robot itself so less efficient

Q: Is there any other feedback?

P: no I don't think so I think that maybe in the final experiment the delayed control delay communication delay on thing is a little bit irritating because it's like in the middle and you can't see anything else but other than that it's good yes good experiment

## Participant 27

Q: what are your thoughts on the two different methods of control?

P: The waypoint was a lot simpler and a lot less taxing on the body yeah I think it took a lot of the mental preparation that you had to do of planning your route out so you just you know you just select it go for it but the delay didn't make any difference if anything delay helped go faster because you could just be thinking ahead and then by the time it was like ready to go you already set up and ready with the next point set up yeah the other one was fine it's a little dizzying yeah felt more like a game yeah

Q: so if you had a system with no communication delay which control method do you think you would use?

P: with no delay it's still the Waypoint I think

Q: And with the delay?

P: Waypoint as well, if speed is the object yeah if like enjoying the environments the objects then the other one.

Q: did you feel like you had more control over the robot when it was in direct control?

P: Umm yes, more control over it but which was a little bit more nerve-wracking kind of that's the wrong word but that lent that emotion it was a little bit more stressful yeah you know if you get backed into a corner then you think what do I do whereas the other one was a little bit more hands-free like the driverless car version of controlling a robot.

Q: Do you think that the fact you were using an immersive interface was beneficial for the task?

P: Yea well yeah I mean it was good I mean it depends whether what the situation is but it felt very useful that you could kind of look around and see what was going on and especially for like your route planning to get to the endpoint being able to kind of see it whereas if it was just a camera you'd feel a little bit static and you probably have another thing to be controlling like the camera view as well which would be a bit yeah a bit too much

Q: Was there anything else that could have helped you perform the task?

P: Umm no I mean if you had a map of the route beforehand that would probably help generally and then you'd kind of you'd already know where you were kind of aiming for that would help the speed but generally it seemed alright it was quite you know you had enough time to look around and see where you were going mostly yeah

## Participant 28

Q: what your thoughts on the two methods of control you used?

P: um I think that the Waypoint control worked really well like the direct control was like fine so long as you didn't have that delay but even with the delay like I didn't like I noticed that there was a difference with the waypoint control but it didn't feel as bad if that makes sense yeah yeah no I definitely preferred the waypoint control to the direct

Q: even when there was no delay?

P: even when there was no delay because I think it required less effort with the like with the Waypoint control and also the direct control like it was quite sensitive and dependent on where you put your thumb so sometimes I'd be like trying to go forwards and it would take me in a circle I'd be like nah that's not what I'm doing here and then I'd have to keep going but then like I did get used to it really quickly so I could deal with that and even with the delay like the direct control you did kind of get used to it in the more open spaces it was just more frustrating with the like closer spaces so with like the big turns it was kind of fine because you could just do like a little bit and then like wait and turn a little bit and then just you'd have time I guess yeah

Q: is there anything that you thought could make either the two controls better or easier to use?

P: I mean the Waypoint control I thought that worked really well I didn't get any like nausea or anything so like I can't really attest to that the direct control I think maybe if there was some sort of but I don't really know how it would work but if you like had something to deal with the fact that like with the delay like rather than you just moving slow also like but then I guess that comes back to my issues with the controlling things because it felt like I would flip between like the top three controls or something or I would be trying to move sideways and it would try and move me forwards yeah and that with the delay was quite frustrating because it would be like after like I'd make a mistake and then it would like happen and stuff so maybe something that was just a bit more you had to actively push down and sort of just being in touch thing

Q: I was thinking something like a joystick might have been better

P: yeah I think it was okay but maybe if like if you wanted to turn on the spot like actually having to push down rather than just touch sideways because that might made it a bit easier to differentiate between but yeah but that's the only thing I can really think of but maybe that's just because the delay with the Waypoint control just didn't bother me really yeah you still like because you're planning that far in advance anyway like you're still at least I was choosing next waypoints before I got to the Waypoint before because I just wanted to keep moving rather than actually getting somewhere stopping and then deciding where to go next

Q: Did you think having being immersed in the kind of camera view from the road what was useful for tasks or would you preferred it was like on a screen

P: I liked being where the robot was. I liked being able to move with it because it helped to be able to sort of swivel around and see what everything like was doing like where everything was and I thought that that was really helpful like if you were not with the robot it would make it more difficult to achieve the task there's at least this way like I mean there were times where I was like I would move like the first trial I did like I went the wrong way and then I was like well I can't get this way and then like I'd have to move back but if you didn't have the camera on the robot like if you had it on the outside you'd have lots of like occlusions and stuff yeah like unless you had a bird's-eye view but even then I feel like that would make it worse to control I don't know like it would be harder. I liked being the robot in summary

Q: Is there any other feedback?

P: no I thought it was really good and yeah basically everything apart from the last one, the direct control the delay, was easy to handle

## Participant 29

Q: so what your thoughts on the two different control methods you saw?

P: I think the second one's the waypoint control is it's definitely easier to use although part of me wonders how much of it is because of the path planning for the robot just because you can say like you do it for me yeah it feels like in a in a real environment it might not be able to exactly tell whether it can fit through again so easily yes also why even bother having a human at all then, why not just tell it to drive itself.

Q: I guess in certain nuclear settings they don't want or wont accept full autonomy and in a lot of tasks it will still be human-driven exploration of the environment. if it's just a mapping task you might be able to have an autonomous agent, but often it's not.

P: so like the high level path planning is a human thing yeah exactly yeah

Q: yeah but you're right to say that the low-level path planning would be less seamless than it is in real life than it was in those trials

Q: So did you prefer doing that methods without delay as well?

P: I still think that I like the delay

Q: you like like the delay?

P: yeah but it was still in in both categories like with and without delay it was better, in fact considerably better than the other one because I kept you know overturning and having to counteract the other method gives you a lot more time to think because most of the time it just the robot that's doing the moving

Q: was there anything that you thought to made the task easier?

P: Not having those arrows flashing up. no probably not well I mean not in the second case in the former case no probably not yet as long as you can't move faster then without like a big jump to a completely different methods they're both reasonable for what they were

Q: and do you think the fact that you were viewing the robots camera through a headset - do you think that was beneficial for the task or would you have preferred it was just on a screen or an immersive screen even

P: I don't know because I haven't compared I'm not sure if it was that useful compared to a screen A lot of the time I forgot that I could look around I guess more more use you'd get used to that because yea most of the time I was just looking where the robot was looking exactly so yeah I couldn't say

## Participant 30

Q: What do you think the two methods of control?

P: The first one was much easier because you point to one place and then takes you there that's much more easier otherwise the navigation can be funny and with the system I mean it's not the same as when you are walking on the street or when you are driving a car I know so I don't know if you intend to use like this way the robot you in the future you're gonna use the robot this way with the VR headset? yeah yeah it makes yeah I was more sick the second and the fourth one I mean the third and fourth yeah I think that really influences your capability where you're going or running into another object. It impacted the task

Q: do you think the VR was useful for the task or would you have preferred it on a screen?

P: no I think it was useful, definitely useful. The first one was very easy to use and I think was very good also the delays they meant to have to delay so what was the why did you put in the second and in the fourth one why did you put delays in to the task?

Q: because a lot of like real world systems especially in nuclear robotics have delays of about that long

P: yeah I think it wasn't a big big difference didn't make a big difference

Q: in either case?

P: In either case yeah and I had one more question yeah the arrows, the arrows which that you have to sometimes you forgot to click because pop up it's just kind of confusing by what I mean I guess it was the arrows meant to project where you are going give you directions no?

Q: the red yeah the red ones no so they were just measuring your light response time

P: okay okay

Q: they weren't putting you off they were? Were they making you go wrong?

P: no no no no no no I uh yeah obviously wasn't making if I go that direction I wouldn't find the route, but I wasn't sure what was the purpose of the arrows

Q: it's just it's meant to be measuring like your response time like how much you're like thinking about the task

P: and it's confusing that there's a yellow arrow and the red arrows because if wouldn't be an arrow it would be easier I think. It was a good task.

## Participant 31

P: all the changes direction are hard to deal with

Q: I think if you're used to or you have operated anything like that in the past then you can learn to predict it quite quickly

P: Yeah in the second one in the direct control with delay you very quickly you learn to anticipate what to run the right timing to get the next

Q: Some people do

P: The delay was always the same? or it was a bit randomised?

Q: It was constant

P: Yea so I found it quite easy to actually adapts to adjust to delay in that case if the delay would have been random so I got it wrong quite a few times and did have quite a few collisions if the delay had have been random even like a little bit random I dunno, two seconds plus or minus one second I think could have been much harder

Q: Yea I thought about doing a variable delay but I wanted to prove it for the best case. In general what did you think of the two different control methods?

P: So if it were not for this motion sickness that was for me much longer in the teleport then the teleport is very nice I think what I really like with the teleport was the path planning would actually choose the shortest path or at least I would assume it does select the shortest path that I would not be able to figure out quickly in the direct control and that does reflect in the time and because the visibility was most of the time decent you can actually select the next Waypoint quite far away so you don't have to do it that often, so that was very good plus the fact that the delay completely disappears with the teleport because since in any case you anticipate by a few seconds where you want to go the fact that there is a delay in communication doesn't impact at all the efficiency of the control no so yeah, they were both okay in the teleport was better except for this very strong motion sickness

Q: was there anything you thought could have made either of them better other than reducing sickness somehow?

P: in some sense it's kind of frustrating that if the robot is able to do the path planning to my next teleport target it should be able to do the path planning to the final target as well yeah so why do I even I guess the story is that we we don't know the final target or we don't have the map so we would not be able to do path planning beyond the physical horizon of the robot. Yeah, I dunno, what would I change? I guess one thing that would make the whole control easier would be like a bird's eye view of the scene not to be stuck with the robot or possibly even without having a bird view which would be like a drone or something just being able to freely move in the environment and then you could set the waypoint. I could possibly like walk faster than the robot because of course that's not something you can do in the decommissioning context because you can not be. or having like a smaller faster robots to explore that you can control and set the Waypoint

Q: so if you were to if you had a mapped environment then you could like possibly you know in VR you could literally just teleport around the environment and drop little waypoint markers and the robot could follow them.

P: So if it is already mapped the problem is solved because you have your map you can just draw on the map whatever you want but it's more likely scenario is you don't know environment yeah having having a robot a smaller more agile robot that could be use to explore and decide where to go and then the larger robots that possibly carries the arm or it's a bit slower then follows that follow follows you a couple of metres behind that could be nice because the whole thing is quite slow so sometimes you're just like waiting yeah which makes sense when you have a pretty big robot that needs to carry stuff, but having this more agile more faster robot to explore

Q: and did you think did you find the fact that you were kind of immersed in the camera feed from the robot useful or would you have preferred if it was just camera on the screen that you could turn with a controller?

P: it kind of connects to the bird view idea where you could have a different perspective the nice thing with being in the ego perspective of robots is that it's much easier to see where you're going to fit wide enough for the robot to go I think it was quite easy to recognise that and your set up your setup was really good because of the diversity of objects you could at some point wonder whether you could fit, but being embedded in the robot was quite easy to quite good quite effective to have a feeling of width

## Participant 32

Q: so what did you think about the control methods you used?

P: the first one was very easy because all I have to do is just point directions and let it go. The second one you have more control so maybe people find some people might like it but I prefer the first one because that involves less control so I don't need to do a lot.

Q: Would you prefer if it's just on the screen? so you're essentially seeing the camera from the virtual robot would you prefer if that camera feed was projected on the screen

P: Yeah

## Participant 33

Q: what your thoughts from the two different methods of control you used?

P: I really liked the Waypoint after I got my head around how it worked initially I was very concerned that I couldn't turn around easily yeah so in that instance you probably want to switch and turn but actually you can just turn around and plonk a waypoint behind. I just didn't have to think about anything it's just like put a point as far as way as I could and let the robot get there, but I found it a lot easier with the Waypoint

Q: so if like if you have a system with no communication delay do, in what situations do you think you would use direct control and waypoint control?

P: I think I'd always want to use the Waypoint even even with direct if it knows where it's going I guess if get stuck I'd want to take over and try and Jimmy it around and get out of the bit that it's trapped in, but other than that, it seemed to know - I had trust in it that it knew a good route of getting wherever I threw the thing so that you know initially I couldn't find my way past the obstacles whereas obviously with the Waypoint I just throw it past the obstacles and let it do the hard work of finding its way around them.

Q: And so you preferred it without delay, and if there was a delay?

P: I think I found with the direct control it was really awkward having a delay really awkward and it was it was nice not having to constantly control it with the Waypoint because I found that even though I thought I was pushing or resting forward I was actually left or right and especially the delay by the time you've realized that you're way off over there instead of there so the waypoint was kind of more relaxing when there's a bit of delay and I guess the delay was incredibly consistent as well, so I knew exactly how long it was gonna take and there was no delay between, I guess there wouldn't be, between me placing the the marker which I guess is the bit - if there was a delay on that it would be an absolute pain - but the delay in it routing and coming back to me to say its got a route is not an issue because you can obviously plan ahead and I guess in a nuclear thing it's not too much about a race against time it's going to be more about being very careful so I don't think delay in that instance is an issue and I guess the waypoint way is a nice way of getting around that sort of horridness of trying to control the robot if there is a delay especially an inconsistent delay

Q: And did you think the fact that you were immersed in the world, was that useful or would you have preferred it on a screen?

P: I loved it and the immersion was great but I don't know if that's just a novelty because ultimately I suppose if that level of Waypoint finding is available ultimately I could have a top-down view of it and just say get over here please and then sit back and relax, whereas in here it was gamified so that I could only reach a waypoint a bit in the distance not all the way to the end but it certainly worked and the feedback was good and it was very immersive I didn't feel motion sickness at all

Q: In either control method?

P: no no both were absolutely fine yeah compared to the simulator when I went in that for the self-driving car thing. I think I was one of the first guinea pigs for the full test like the day before they start to run the full trials and they put me through as many as I could stand and you know it's horrible, it was really horrible. but that (this experiment) was fine I think you got used to it really quickly and I think the the control actually having because that (autonomous car experiment) was completely passive you just have to sit back and and take all the car moving around and everything whereas this I can move my head and everything changed and I can move my hands and everything changed and I think that sort of really told my brain you're okay you are sort of in control there is there is a matchup between what you're seeing and what you're doing

Q: I think that it is important for your brain to be able to predict what's going to happen visually, it has a big impact on whether you get sick or not and your sense of control - people I've seen in the experiment that are really unsure especially with the waypoint control and with direct control with delay if they're unsure about whats about to happen then they get flustered and start to feel sick

Q: So from a computer vision point of view how difficult do you think it'd be to have that target selection and understand where the floor is and what obstacles are where, do you think that's a feasible thing?

P: It's tricky so breaking it down and then, I haven' thought about this at all, breaking it down to a simpler task so in a lab on a floor like this with some obstacles, probably. I think in the real world it gets potentially really nasty we've got we've done a project with a company called Q-Bot doing this on underground or floor below the floor voids yeah and so that part of so our side was doing the recognition of different things to know whether to spray or not spray and their side was doing scanning and automatic way finding all the way around so it was using pretty standard techniques to know areas that it hadn't explored to go and explore around there yeah and then it build up a really quite a good map so it could then find its way back again but it would be non non trivial I would say yeah you've also got the issue if this is a nuclear thing and there's high levels of radiation - cameras just don't work they get blown up so Tom's work is doing whiskers and stuff because apparently all the cameras just fizzle and die very quickly. It would be a very interesting problem that is the sort of thing, well Kez's thing is as far as I can see probably one of the best ways to doing it because that is going to be Waypoint finding at least once it's got a camera on it it'll just have things saying find your way to the red ball and then it's gonna learn hopefully there's an obstacle there, there's an obstacle there, and it'll work out how to go around and work out a route yeah you know, but it is yeah that's a tricky problem I think it might better to do it not purely vision you can use depth sensors but yeah I don't know what the levels of radiation are and whether things will work in it. Whiskers, you might want to talk to Tom about whiskers and it's just one of those things, as far as I've heard everyone didn't really realize how bad cameras were gonna die. So that's what you're planning to do is it? put this on a real thing? don't don't worry if I say it's hard hard because I've not done anything like this so it might be really easy

Q: Yeah you're right, ignoring the constraints of the nuclear environment it might be possible, and then adding on those constraints it might be impossible - I don't know.

P: because what's the terrain like?

Q: I think it's quite cluttered, from what I've seen, just from images, it's quite cluttered but like reasonable - it's kind of like being in a bit like a warehouse

P: Right

Q: depends which kind of nuclear environment you're in, if you're in an exploded Chernobyl situation then it's probably extremely difficult, but in different nuclear environments I think a lot of it is fairly reasonable terrain

P: It's ridiculous isn't it that they haven't demarked certain areas like do not ever place anything in here - just to allow roots to always exist. I guess that's gonna be an issue is people actually know where everything is in these areas that you're trying to explore

Q: yeah probably possibly in some cases but probably not in a lot of cases

P: No, that's gonna be fun as well as I suppose having to work out how to get through the maze - very fun

Q: Is there any other feedback about the experiment?

P: no really really good really enjoyable I'd happily do that as I say for days and days, but I'm not sure it would be the most efficient way of getting the task done

## Participant 34

Q: What were your thoughts on the two control methods you saw?

P: I thought Waypoint control was much smoother and it was much easier to deal with the communication delay. It again the delay adds like time pressure to everything but because you weren't controlling it directly you didn't need to compensate for it while you were thinking about it so it was much easier to just focus on where the robot was going as opposed to how the robot gets there, which was much nicer. Direct control without the delay it was fine and I guess I've played a fair amount of like driving games so it just make sense and but I would prefer the waypoint control

Q: Even when there was no delay?

P: I'd say even when there was no delay because it again it removes the having to think about how are you getting to the point you just need to go where would be the best vague direction to point it in and then the robot sorts everything else out yourself so you can focus on when the arrows flash up or whatever else is going on at the same time

Q: So the fact that you were in an immersive headset, do you think that was beneficial to the task or do you think you'd prefers if the camera feeds was on a screen?

P: I think I would prefer it with the VR because if you're trying to control a body regardless of what the body is or where the body is it's nice to feel as though you're part of that body. I'm sure the screen would be just as effective and for some people it might be better and with the nausea, but I personally I would prefer the headset I think just because it means you can have like a comprehensive look around the environment.

Q: Was there any other feedback?

P: No, it was good fun I really enjoyed it

## Participant 35

Q: What were your thoughts on the two different control methods you saw?

P: I think the second one (waypoint control) was much more relaxed like you don't have to think that much. Because you can basically just make a waypoint press go and then just do whatever you want

Q: Did you prefer that then?

P: I did, yeah

Q: If your system had no communication delay do you think you would still use waypoint?

P: in a work environment yes, but if it's for video gaming no. so basically if you have to react really fast I think it's still easier without waypoints but if you have time and just want to travel or look around an environment like this then I think waypoint was easier

Q: And how did communication delay impact the two?

P: I think it had a much bigger impact with no waypoints but the mode with waypoints it didn't really matter much anymore

Q: Do you think it was useful being immersed in the camera feed or would you prefer it if it was on a screen?

P: I think for me wouldn't have made a difference not that much I think it's I mean I'm fine but I I understand why people might feel a bit dizzy because the moment you look at your hands it gets a bit weird but if you just look straight ahead it's fine yeah so that's why I think it might be easier on a screen

Q: Was there any other feedback about the experiment?

P: On the task there's not I just found this one really confusing (Performance scale on NASA-TLX Questionnaire) like I expected good to be on this end and poor to be this end

Q: did you consistently score it then or?

P: Yeah I did.

Q: Was there anything else?

P: During the tutorial I had to focus much more than if it was a written tutorial which I found a tiny bit more difficult . Also the first time without waypoints no delay I just totally forgot the left hand that's why the delays are huge the entire trial I I did the task it just took much longer because I totally forgot about

Q: I don't think the secondary tasks going to show much anyway because well if anything is gonna show that when you have when people were in the waypoint control they're worse because they're either having like high mental load trying to place the thing or like so low that they kind of just relax and forget to respond very quickly.

P: I don't know, I think with Waypoint control it I reacted much faster because I've nothing else to do but when you were controlling it maybe the entire time you were busy everything else

## Participant 37

Q: What were your thoughts on the two different methods of control you saw?

P: waypoints was easier really because you don't have to think about all the detail like the getting around the barrels and so on where you've got to like actively drive round and make sure you come off at the right angle, you can just aim past it and just sorts it out. So you just got more thinking time really

Q: so are there any situations where you think you would use direct control?

P: Yeah when if you go the wrong direction and get stuck it's it's quite difficult to turn around with the waypoint because you've gotta go like that (does turning round gesture) but direct you can just do like the reverse , but apart from that waypoints pretty good

Q: so what about with communication delay, how did that affect the two control methods?

P: It made direct a fair bit more difficult especially right at the start I ended up just crashing a few times into stuff just because you sometimes if like the robot gets ahead of you then you trying to correct but it's already like ploughing into an obstacle and you're trying to get out, yeah it makes direct a lot harder. Waypoints not too bad because again you just tell it where you want it to go and it'll go straight there so even if it's in a mass you just have - where you want to go is just a constant whilst if you're in direct the action you want to take is always changing but it's always behind a delay as well, but if it's Waypoint it's just 'I want to go there'.

Q: and did you think being immersed in the camera feed from the robot, was that beneficial for this task or would you have preferred it if it was just on a screen

P: Hard to say without trying it, but it seems it seemed really natural and quite easy it was just it's just the difficulty if you have to make like a big big turn to to do that whilst you know if you're on like mouse and keyboard you it'd be a lot easier to do the big turns but it's quite, it feels pretty easy to use

Q: There were basically, in one of the earlier versions of it I had click turns as well so you could either 90 degrees or a full 180 of the camera view so you didn't have to physically turn around, so it would turn it for you, but then you have to learn more controls, and in such a short experiment I didn't think it was worth it. If you were designing the system for a nuclear operator or an operator that could receive some amount of training then you'd definitely add in more complexity and functionality.

Q: Any other feedback?

P: No, it was pretty fun
